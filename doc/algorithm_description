The program can be started by running visitors.php. The actual algorithms
to find the maximum number of visitors and the time ranges are in the file
Visitor_Calculator.php. Before those are used, the times are read from the file
and after converting them to minutes and sorting them according to the arrival
time they are saved in an array called _visitors.

The findMax() function finds the maximum number of simultaneous visitors
in the museum by going through the _visitor array and marking in the 
_minuteArray array how many visitors have been in the museum at each minute.

In the _minuteArray array index zero is marking the time of the arrival of the
first visitor. The next index marks the first arrival time + 1 minute, the next
one marks the first arrival time + 2 minutes and so on. Therefore the
algorithm starts at index current visitors arrival time - first arrival time and
continues until index current visitor leaving time - first arrival time
increasing the number by one in each index.

After the findMax() algorithm has finished, the _minuteArray array's index i
will have the number of visitors at time t0 + i where t0 = arrival time of the
first visitor. The algorithm also saves the maximum numbers of visitors in
variable _max and returns that value.

The time ranges with the most visitors are found by using the findRanges() 
function. The function goes through the _minuteArray and saves the
beginning(s) and end(s) of the interval(s) with most visitors. The function
determines that it has found a beginning of an interval if the value of the
_minuteArray at the current index is the same as the maximum value of the 
visitors and the current index is either in the beginning of the array or the
value at the next index is not the same as the maximum value of the visitors. 
Similar logic is being used to find the end(s) of the interval(s).
